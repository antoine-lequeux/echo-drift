# echo-drift

Echo Drift is an educational project to learn software architecture engineering and train my c++ skills.
It will be a simple 2D game where the player can control a spaceship and shoot enemies while avoiding asteroids. More features might be added when I'm done with the core.

It relies on SFML3 to manage graphics and audio.

It is still in a very early stage of development, and I'm actively working on the project.
